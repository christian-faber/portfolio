Cover:
  - Configure aspects so they don't change on zoom. Might be better to do 3 different size aspects and leave it there.
  - Figure out where to put the Top Menu. Does it go on the cover?
  - Add gradient outline on hover for buttons

Home:
  - When I update the portfolio array with this app, change the slice to (1,4)

Portfolio:
  - Map through the array. Include this application in the list.
  - Create modal to display more information when a project is clicked on.

Experiences:
  - Change dot location
  - Make line a left border of container div for this
  - create gradient outline on hover for Experience cards
